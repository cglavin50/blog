# Who am I?
I am an undergraduate at Georgetown University, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, and a minor in Mathematics, graduating in May 2024. Passionate about problem-solving, networking, and developing an easy-access internet for all, I love to learn and am always looking to find new tech to dive into. 
## What do I do?
I am currently involved with anti-censorship research involving new network protocols on campus, and am a backend developer who enjoys learning web-dev on the side. I love to code, and have been diving into Go recently as my language of choice, however am also interested in deployments and devops.
### Goals
As I love to learn, I wanted to create this page as a blog post, where I intend to write one article covering something new I learned, every day. That way, I hold myself accountable, and I can use this as a place to refer back to when I want to build off something I remember from a previous review day.
