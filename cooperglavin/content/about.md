# Who am I?
I am an undergraduate at Georgetown University, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, and a minor in Mathematics, graduating in May 2024. Passionate about problem-solving, networking, and developing an easy-access internet for all, I love to learn and am always looking to find new tech to dive into. 
## What do I do?
I am currently involved with anti-censorship research involving new network protocols on campus, and am a backend developer who enjoys learning web-dev on the side. I love to code, and have been diving into Go recently as my language of choice. As a tech nerd, I'm also interested in deployments/devops, and in general just love configuring computers.
### Goals
As I love to learn, I wanted to create this page as a blog post, where I intend to write one article covering something new I learned, every day. That way, I hold myself accountable, and I can use this as a place to refer back to when I want to build off something I remember from a previous review day. I want to grow as a developer, and with this I can trick myself into coding for at least 30 minutes a day, and force myself to find some new tech, language, framework, what-have-you that interests me everyday.
